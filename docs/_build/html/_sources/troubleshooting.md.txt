# Troubleshooting & Common Errors

This page lists typical errors you may encounter when running the **CryoGrid Optimization 
Automatization** workflow, along with possible solutions.

---

## ⚠️ MATLAB Errors

### `Undefined function or variable`
- **Cause**: A script or function is not in the MATLAB path.  
- **Solution**: Make sure that the `src/` and `CryoGrid/` folders are added to the MATLAB path:
```
    matlab
    addpath(genpath('src/'))
    addpath(genpath('CryoGrid/'))
```

Note : Add path with folder and subfolders

### Index exceeds matrix dimensions

Cause: Sensor data file (CSV) is not correctly formatted.

Solution: Check that the CSV has columns DATE and TEMP with no missing values.

Another thing to see if missing values, in the `results_*sensor_ID*.xlsx` file, you may have empty values
for statistics indicators.

## 📂 File & Path Issues

### File not found: measurement file

If you have this error message : 
```
matlab
❌ No .csv or .xlsx measurement file found for sensor "sensor_ID".
```
Cause: Wrong path to the `data/` folder in the configuration section or not contain columns `DATA` and 
`TEMP`. It could be a problem with the sensor_ID. It can be not the same between your configuration 
section, Excel metadata file or in your measurement file name.

Solution: Verify the file is located in data/ and update sensor_file accordingly.
Verify that your measurement file is called exactly : `*sensor_ID*_daily_mean.csv`.
Check the exemple file.

### Forcing .mat files not recognized

If you have this error message : 
```
matlab
❌ No FORCING file found for  sensor "sensor_ID".
```

Cause: Wrong path to the `Forcing_Data/` folder in the configuration section or not containn rigth 
variables. It could be a problem with the sensor_ID. It can be not the same between your configuration 
section, Excel metadata file or in your forcing file name.

Solution: Ensure they contain temperature and precipitation variables as expected.
Verify that your forcing file starts exactly by `FORCING_*` and finishes by `*_sensor_ID`.
Check the exemple file.


## CryoGrid issues

Cause : Incorect path to CryoGrid folders and file in the configuration section. 
Incorect CryoGrid configuration.
No autorization to modify the Excel files.

Solution : Check the path.
Check autorizations.
Check your CryoGrid configuration and CryoGrid documentation.


## ⚡ Optimization Issues

### Optimization stops after few iterations
Cause: Parameter bounds are too restrictive or lead to invalid CryoGrid runs.

Solution: Check and expand the Bayesian parameter bounds in configuration.md.

### Parallel workers crash
Cause: Too many workers allocated for available system memory.

Solution: Reduce the number of workers in MATLAB Parallel Preferences.

## Issues in the objective function 

You will not have an error message because it's in the parallelisation loop.

To detect a problem, you have to go to the `CryoGridCommunity_results/CG_single/` folder. 
- First step, check if there is a .mat result file in your workers folders. If there is not a .mat file 
after a long time after the beginning of the simulation it's because the CryoGrid script doesn't work. 
--> Test to run CryoGrid in isolation

- Second step, check if the `temp_results` folder is created with the results files. If it is not the case
you have a problem with your path to create this folder.


## Nanmin error

There is a conflict between a CryoGrid and a Matlab bayesopt function. This function name is : nanmin.
This error says :

```
matlab
Error nanmin
Too many input arguments
```

Normally, the program is done to avoid this conflict.Add

Cause : This error can appear if you have several CryoGrid folders in your Matlab path.

Solution : Simply place a single CryoGrid folder in your MatLab path and specify the correct paths to 
the CryoGrid source and results in your configuration section. The programme removes the path to the 
CryoGrid source before launching the bayesopt loop and adds it before the CryoGrid execution script. Once
the CryoGrid simulation is complete, the path to the source is removed again.



## ✅ Best Practices

Always start with a fresh MATLAB session before launching main_optimization_parallel.m.

Keep your `data/`, `forcing/`, `/src` and `CryoGrid/` folders well organized.

If you add a new sensor, verify its metadata in `PAPROG_Data.xlsx`
